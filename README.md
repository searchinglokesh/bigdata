   - **Hive**: Distributed data warehouse supporting SQL-like queries (HQL)
   - **Spark**: High-performance data processing engine (100x faster than traditional Hadoop)

3. **Storage and Database**:
   - **HBase**: Distributed, column-oriented database
   - **Avro**: Data serialization system for efficient RPC and persistent storage

4. **Coordination and Management**:
   - **ZooKeeper**: Distributed coordination service
   - **Oozie**: Workflow scheduling system

5. **Data Ingestion and Transfer**:
   - **Flume**: Service for collecting and moving large amounts of streaming data
   - **Chukwa**: Distributed data collection and analysis system
   - **Kafka**: Event streaming platform

6. **Search and Indexing**:
   - **Solr/Lucene**: Enterprise search and indexing capabilities

### Q: Why is Hadoop popular?
A: Hadoop is popular for several key reasons:

1. **Data Handling Capabilities**:
   - Processes massive amounts of varied data types
   - Handles both structured and unstructured data
   - Supports flexible storage decisions

2. **Cost-Effectiveness**:
   - Open-source framework
   - Runs on commodity hardware
   - Reduces storage and processing costs

3. **Performance and Scalability**:
   - Distributed processing capabilities
   - Linear scalability by adding nodes
   - High computing power for large datasets

4. **Data Protection**:
   - Built-in data replication
   - Fault tolerance
   - Protection against hardware failures

## HDFS Architecture and Operations

### Q: What is HDFS and how does it work?
A: HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) is a distributed file system designed for:

1. **Key Characteristics**:
   - Runs on commodity hardware
   - Highly fault-tolerant
   - Optimized for large datasets
   - Follows "write-once, read-many" pattern

2. **Architecture Components**:
   - **NameNode** (Master):
     - Manages filesystem namespace
     - Stores metadata
     - Controls block mapping
   - **DataNodes** (Slaves):
     - Store actual data blocks
     - Handle read/write requests
     - Manage block operations

3. **Block Management**:
   - Default block size: 64MB
   - Each block replicated multiple times (default: 3)
   - Replicas distributed across different nodes

### Q: How does HDFS handle file reading?
A: The file reading process follows these steps:

1. Client initiates by calling `open()` on FileSystem object
2. NameNode provides block locations via RPC
3. Client establishes connection with nearest DataNode
4. Data streams directly from DataNode to client
5. Process continues block by block
6. Client closes stream when finished

### Q: How does HDFS handle file writing?
A: The file writing process involves:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Client creates file using `create()`
   - NameNode verifies permissions and file existence

2. **Data Flow**:
   - Data split into packets
   - Packets queued for writing
   - Pipeline of DataNodes established

3. **Writing Process**:
   - Data streams through DataNode pipeline
   - Each DataNode stores and forwards
   - Acknowledgments sent back through pipeline

4. **Completion**:
   - Client calls `close()`
   - NameNode confirms completion
   - Block replication verified

### Q: How does HDFS handle failures during writing?
A: HDFS handles writing failures through:

1. **Pipeline Recovery**:
   - Failed DataNode removed from pipeline
   - Unacknowledged packets requeued
   - Pipeline reconstructed with remaining nodes

2. **Block Management**:
   - New block identity assigned
   - Partial blocks on failed node deleted
   - Additional replicas created as needed

### Q: What is HDFS's replica placement strategy?
A: HDFS uses a sophisticated replica placement strategy:

1. **First Replica**:
   - Placed on client's node (if client is on cluster)
   - Random node chosen for external clients

2. **Additional Replicas**:
   - Second replica on different rack
   - Third replica on same rack as second
   - Further replicas distributed randomly

3. **Considerations**:
   - Network topology awareness
   - Rack diversity for redundancy
   - Balance between reliability and bandwidth

## Additional Components

### Q: What is Hive and its components?
A: Hive is a data warehouse system for Hadoop:

1. **Key Components**:
   - Command-line interface
   - JDBC/ODBC connectivity

2. **Features**:
   - Highly scalable
   - Supports batch and real-time processing
   - Compatible with various data stores
   - SQL-like query language (HQL)

### Q: What is Apache Kafka?
A: Kafka is an event streaming platform that provides:

1. End-to-end event streaming
2. Publish-subscribe capability for event streams
3. Durable storage of event streams
4. Real-time event processing

### Q: What is YARN's role in Hadoop?
A: YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator) serves as:

1. **Resource Management**:
   - Cluster resource allocation
   - Task scheduling
   - Processing activity management

2. **Components**:
   - Resource Manager (master)
   - Node Managers (on each DataNode)
   - Application Master (per-application)
